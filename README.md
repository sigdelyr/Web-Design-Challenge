# Summary


For this project, i will be creating a weather analysis dashboard website using visualizations that created in past assignment (Assignment-WeatherPy). Mainly, I'll be plotting weather data. To make this dashboard, I create first individual pages for each plot and then navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
